# Anis-Makesh-WORK

Throughout this project we got to learn a lot about Hemodynamics and the way blood flows throughout veins and arteries. To do the simulations, I used MATLAB and SolidWorks. In MATLAB, I used the Finite Element Analysis Toolbox (FEAToolbox Multiphysics) which can be downloaded using the APPS tab and selecting it through the Add-ins available there. FEAToolbox allows users to perform Computational Fluid Dynamics calculations by utilising different flow equations such as the Navier-Stokes Equations and set up a simulation with variable Geometry, Equation and Boundary Settings. For the simulation on, laminar flow, Vein blood flow and blood flow for someone with Artherosclerosis a 2D space dimention setting was used. Also in MATLAB, an add-in called 'Hagen-Poiseuille Flow' was used to show variation of velocity across the cross section of arteries & veins and the variation of shear stress across different blood vessels. With SolidWork, I did two simulations: the first one looked at creating a laminar fluid flow in a tube and the second simulation was one which simulated blood flow between veins and arteries, by creating a venturi effect tunnel. I have uploaded the SolidwWorks Part file for both the simulations and also included a PDF & Word document describing the results from these simulations. In this repository I have also uploaded the writern notes that forms the background for this PSIV project. The PDFs and Word files mainly cover the background and results whereas the MATLAB code and SolidWorks file contain active work done throughout the project. 

For the SolidWorks Fluid Flow simulations, the Flow Simulation Add-in was required. This was not available with my Student License so the computers in the Fulton Building were used to utilise this tool. Then a tool call 'Wizard' was used for the fluid simulations. It included blood as a pre-defined Non-Newtonian Liquid and it was selected for the simulation. Subsequently, wall thermal conditions had to be defined. With average blood temperature being 37C , the wall temperature were  set to 310 Kelvin for an accurate representation. Then the dimentions were set to represent blood veins and arteries, and the simulation was run.
